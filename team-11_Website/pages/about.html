    <h2>This weekend we had an amazing opportunity to develop technology for Rare. We believe
      this is an incredible opportunity to change the world for the better.
      According to experts, the primary reason for trash in oceans is because of
      litters in the streets. Rainwater moves the trash into the storm drains which empties into streams,
      rivers and other bodies of water. Litter causes health problems such as hormonal issues, reproductive
      issues, and damage to the nervus system and kidneys. Car pollution is another major cause of global warming.
      Cars and trucks emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which according to statistics is 1/5 of the U.S.'s total
      global warming pollution. Warmer global temperatures causes damage to farm crops, wildlife, sea levels and even
      natural landscapes.
