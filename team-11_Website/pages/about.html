          This weekend we had an amazing opportunity to develop technology for Rare. We believe
      this is an incredible opportunity to change the world for the better.
      According to experts, the primary reason for trash in oceans is because of
      litters in the streets. Rainwater moves the trash into the storm drains which empties into streams,
      rivers and other bodies of water. Litter causes health problems such as hormonal issues, reproductive
      issues, and damage to the nervus system and kidneys. Car pollution is another major cause of global warming.
      Cars and trucks emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which according to statistics is 1/5 of the U.S.'s total
      global warming pollution. Warmer global temperatures causes damage to farm crops, wildlife, sea levels and even
      natural landscapes.

      My team and I were inspired this weekend to build a creative and innovate way to influence others to clean the Earth.
      We want to create a fun way for users to clean up the Earth by challenging one another to do the challenges we have. This website
      is a platform where users can upload videos of them doing the challenges and other users watching the videos will feel inspired
      to do the challenge as well. We noticed this to be effective when we tried multiply times to throw the trash away in a "fun" way,
      and someone else expressed interest and wanted to join in as well.

      We ran into a lot of challenges throughout this intense hackathon. We spent around 4-5 hours figuring out the best ideas to make a positive impact on Earth.
      Initially, we had a sure plan of doing iOS development for the user experience. Unfortunately, since the UI part of the app was mostly the
      the implementation and it would take 2-3 people maximum, it was difficult to find code for the other young developers in our team to contribute to.
      With careful thought and the pressure to build this prototype within less than 6 hours, we decided to build a website. Within 1 hour we did over 100
      commits to github and our progress is consistently improving.
