**ChallengeMonkey** is a website where users can challenge each other.

Time spent (coding website part): **5** hours spent in total

## User features

This website allows users to challenge each other while improving the environment. Users can take videos, upload them, like and comment other's videos,
write hashtags and have the opportunity to complete many different challenges will make this a very exciting technology to use.

## Notes

We initially tried to do this using iOS development. But we realized it would be impractical and we needed a way to allow every team member to contribute to code. Doing a website was the best option for this so we were able to develop the website in about 5 hours.
